This is a README File for the API Directory

This directory contains Python scripts to access employee data via an API, and organize, and export them to different data structures. The scripts are part of the ALU Back-End projects.
Description

The scripts in this directory are designed for system administrators and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) who understand the limitations of Bash scripting and prefer to use Python for such tasks. These scripts access an API, retrieve employee data, and export it to different data structures, primarily in JSON format.
