This project aims to create Python scripts to access employee data via an API, and organize and export them to different data structures. It is designed for system administrators and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) who understand the limitations of Bash scripting and prefer to use Python for such tasks.

Introduction

Old-school system administrators often rely solely on Bash scripting to build their automation scripts. However, as the role of SREs has evolved, the need for more versatile and efficient programming languages like Python has become apparent. In this project, we'll use Python to access an API, retrieve employee data, and export it to different data structures.

One popular approach for exposing applications and datasets is through APIs. APIs serve as the public-facing part of websites and microservices, allowing external users to interact with and manipulate data. This project demonstrates the process of accessing employee data via an API and organizing it into structured formats, such as JSON.
